## Description

This is the first demo project, created with the help of v0.ai and simple questions about life expectancy of citizens: poor vs rich and exposure to MOLD infections. Without being a scientist, everybody can do studies like this or create fun projects for children. Enjoy your JPNB-coding!

## Project Overview

This project explores:
1. Life expectancy differences between socioeconomic groups
2. Health impacts of living in damp and moldy conditions

## Setup

To set up the environment, run the following cell in your Jupyter Notebook:

```python
# Setup code here
# (Replace this comment with your actual setup code)
```

## Getting Started

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook files in the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook to explore the data and analyses.

## Files in this Project

- `notebooks/jpnb_demo.ipynb`: Main demo notebook comparing life expectancy between different socioeconomic groups.
- `notebooks/mold_health_impact.ipynb`: Analysis of health impacts related to living in damp and moldy conditions.
- `notebooks/setting_up_private_jpnb.ipynb`: Guide for setting up a private Jupyter Notebook project.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how anyone, regardless of their scientific background, can conduct interesting studies and create engaging projects using Jupyter Notebooks and simple data analysis techniques.

Happy coding!
